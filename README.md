# Landing Page Project - README

## Project Description

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course, designed to help you practice and solidify your HTML and CSS skills. The goal is to create a fully functional landing page based on a provided design.

The design includes two images:
1. A complete layout of the landing page.
2. A guide detailing specific fonts, colors, and design elements used.

The landing page consists of four main sections and a footer. The objective is to replicate the design as closely as possible, focusing on layout, styling, and structure.
